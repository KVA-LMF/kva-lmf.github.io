On October 22, 2021, the National Committee organized a
[one-day workshop for Swedish high school teachers](https://kva.se/kunskapimotvind)
(page in Swedish) in cooperation with
[Knowledge Resistance: Causes, Consequences, and Cures](https://knowledge-resistance.com/)
(a multidisciplinary research
program funded by Riksbankens Jubileumsfond). The aim of the day was to orient
teachers on ideas and developments in current epistemology and philosophy of
science, with a focus on the relevance these debates have for contemporary
public debate.

Presenters included
