### Workshop abstract

Scientific evidence at times generates significant epistemic support for a
hypothesis but falls short of establishing the viability of the hypothesis in a
conclusive way. Scientific theories and hypotheses that remain in such an
intermediate epistemic state for a long time can be found both in fundamental
and in applied science. An adequate understanding of the scientific process
needs to allow for the distinction between conclusively established hypotheses
and significantly but inconclusively supported hypotheses without denying the
epistemic significance of the latter. Moreover, it needs to account for the ways
in which scientific views can be compounds of hypotheses of both types. Examples
of the latter have become publicly highly visible in recent years in the context
of climate change and the Covid crisis. The role of inconclusive but significant
evidence generates problems for the presentation of science to a general public
that tends to expect unquestionable truth from scientific reasoning. It also
generates conceptual problems for the philosophy of science. How can the
distinction between conclusive and significant but inconclusive confirmation of
a hypothesis be squared with the understanding that any scientific hypothesis is
up to modification? How can the gap between credence as a formal conceptual tool
for representing the process of confirmation and credence as a scientist’s
actual degree of trust in a hypothesis be bridged? And how is it possible to
distinguish between scientifically legitimate reasons for having credence in a
scientific theory and mere subjective preference? The workshop will address
these and similar issues by considering specific case studies as well as general
conceptual perspectives.
